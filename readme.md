# Requirements
To run the script `add_rows.py`, you need to have Docker and Python installed.  You also need to intall the psycopg library.  This Python library is used to for interfacing with the PostgreSQL database.  It can be installed with the following command:

    pip install "psycopg[binary]"

If you have all the requirements installed, you should be able to simply run the Python script `add_rows.py` the way you would any other Python script.
